Why are a lot of the photos at the top of a restaurant's Yelp gallery still so bad?  In this project I use photography 101 principles to classify a set of Mexican food photographs in to "good" and "bad".  I then train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict if a given photo should be bumped to the top of the gallery or pushed to the bottom of the gallery.   This model could be used by review platforms or restaurant owners to automatically put the best photos up top.

# Background

** How Photos Are Currently Sorted on Yelp
How can I change which photos of my business appear first?
The order in which photos appear on a business page (including the main photo) is determined by different factors, such as votes from the community and how recently the photo was taken. We also automatically disperse any available videos of the business throughout the photos. You're welcome to add additional photos to your business page, but we don't offer the ability to re-order photos with a free business account.

However, we do offer advertising packages that enable you to set the order of your photos in a slideshow (but currently videos are still automatically dispersed throughout your ordering). If you're interested in an advertising program, please contact our Sales team.
