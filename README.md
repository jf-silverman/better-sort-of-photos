# Capstone Project Part 3 
## Yelp Photos:  The Good, The Bad, and the Blurry

**Project Update**

1. Do you have data fully in hand and if not, what blockers are you facing?

    Yes, I have an initial dataset of 1000 labeled images (2 classes).  It's possible I may need more data, but I can gain more using the same process or I can label existing photos from another set I have in hand.

2. Have you done full EDA on all of your data?

    I have only reviewed all the photos visually to see if the label is right.  I'm not sure what other EDA is appropriate here.  Maybe composite exposure and color histograms of each class?  

3. Have you begun the modeling process? How accurate are your predictions so far?

    I made one initial model with 50/50 of each class that yielded 70% accuracy.

4. What blockers are you facing, including processing power, data acquisition, modeling difficulties, data cleaning, etc.? How can we help you overcome those challenges?

    Just wondering what might be the best next step.  EDA, use a pretrained keras classifier, try adjusting my hyperparameters, try a different model technique?


5. What is your timeline for this week? What do you _have_ to get done versus what would you _like_ to get done?

    I need to get some more EDA done and try a few more models to get a sense for how easy / hard in might be to improve the performance.

6. Are you planning to reach out to schedule another capstone check-in with an instructor this week? If "yes" to the above, what topics do you want to discuss during your 1:1?

    Yes.  I'd like ideas on EDA, model types / adjustment advise.  Thoughts on narrowing the class definitions to focus on more specific cases vs. continuing with same classes.  Thoughts on way to present results.
